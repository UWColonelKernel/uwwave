       "'Are you interested in technology, cutting-edge research and innovative companies? If yes, the Global Innovation Clusters are looking for motivated students to join our Data and Performance team in Winter 2023. \\n<br>\\n&nbsp; \\n<br>\\nWe are seeking one highly motivated co-op student for a placement beginning in January 2023. During the placement, the student would serve as a junior policy analyst, providing strategic, data-driven advice to senior management on the status of the Global Innovation Clusters program. \\n<br>\\n&nbsp; \\n<br>\\n<strong>Background</strong> \\n<br>\\nIn 2017, the Government of Canada challenged&nbsp;Canadian businesses of all sizes to collaborate&nbsp;with other innovation actors, including post-secondary and research institutions, to propose&nbsp;bold and ambitious strategies that would&nbsp;transform regional innovation ecosystems&nbsp;into job-creating engines of economic&nbsp;growth. Five Superclusters were selected for an investment of $950M (to be matched by&nbsp;industry) over five years to incentivize collaboration among firms of all sizes, academia and not-for-profits to build first-rate&nbsp;ecosystems with a global competitive edge, scale up our best SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), and accelerate economic growth. An additional investment of $60M was announced in Budget 2021 to continue support of innovative Canadian projects and firms as part of economic recovery. In Budget 2022, the Superclusters - now known as the Global Innovation Clusters - were announced to receive an additional $750 million over six years, starting in 2022-23. \\n<br>\\n&nbsp; \\n<br>\\nClusters&nbsp;are&nbsp;dense area of business activity&nbsp;containing a critical mass of large and small&nbsp;companies, post-secondary and other research&nbsp;institutions. They energize the economy and act&nbsp;as engines of growth, much like Silicon Valley. ?Canada\\'s Global Innovation Clusters&nbsp;were selected to build&nbsp;on&nbsp;existing networks in areas of competitive&nbsp;advantage&nbsp;for the country: digital technologies, plant-based protein industries, advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence and supply chain logistics, and ocean economy. The Clusters are located regionally, but&nbsp;delivering nationally - opportunity for stronger&nbsp;connections, a long-term competitive advantage,&nbsp;global brand recognition, and an outsized&nbsp;positive impact on job creation and economic&nbsp;growth. \\n<br>\\n&nbsp; \\n<br>\\nAs a department, ISED works with Canadians in all areas of the economy across the country to improve conditions for investment. We enhance Canada\\'s innovation performance, increase Canada\\'s share of global trade and build a fair, efficient, and competitive marketplace. \\n<br>\\n&nbsp; \\n<br>\\n<strong>The Job</strong> \\n<br>\\nOur team is responsible for supporting the Global Innovation Clusters program through tracking key metrics and developing reports for the Deputy Ministers and other government executives. As a member of the team, you would provide research and analytical support, develop creative solutions to improve program delivery, and generate briefing and reporting materials. \\n<br>\\n&nbsp;\\n \\n<div>\\n  \\n \\n <div>\\n   \\n \\n  <div id=\"_com_1\">\\n    &nbsp; \\n  </div>\\n \\n </div>\\n \\n</div>'"
